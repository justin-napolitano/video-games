# Video Games

I am letting go of video games.

## Binge

I binge two games annually.. Crusader Kings (whatver iteration is latest) and Europa Universalis 4. I find maybe twice a year where I play one or the other until I burn out.. Typically about 30 hours.. 

This year I have also played about half of fallout 3 and equally as much of fallout 4.  

## Lonliness

Playing games makes me feel horribly lonely. I mean terribly lonely.. So I play more to distract myself from how lonely I feel. 

## Distraction

I play games to distrct myself from things that I want to actually do.  I wanted to program tonigt.. but I told myself I had done enough.. I should have just programmed.
