# Video Games Repository: Technical and Practical Overview

## Motivation

This project serves as a personal reflective document rather than a traditional software application. The motivation is to externalize thoughts and feelings about video game usage, specifically addressing patterns of binge playing, feelings of loneliness, and the use of gaming as a distraction.

## Problem Statement

While not a software problem, the document addresses a behavioral and emotional issue: the cyclical nature of gaming as both a source of enjoyment and a mechanism for avoiding other activities or emotions. This reflection can provide insight into how personal habits affect productivity and mental state.

## Implementation Details

The repository consists of a single Markdown file (`index.md`) with front matter metadata in TOML format. This metadata includes:

- Title, author, and date
- Tags and categories for thematic classification
- An image reference, suggesting potential use in a static site generator

The content is structured with Markdown headers and paragraphs, detailing the author's experiences with specific games (Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis 4, Fallout 3, Fallout 4) and the emotional impact of gaming.

## Technical Considerations

- The use of TOML front matter indicates compatibility with static site generators like Hugo, which may be used for publishing.
- No programming language or build tools are involved, indicating the repository is primarily for content storage.
- The repository structure is minimalistic, containing only one Markdown file.

## Practical Notes

- The repository functions as a personal journal or blog entry.
- It can be extended by adding more Markdown files or converting into a full static site.
- No dependencies or installation steps are necessary beyond a Markdown viewer.

## Summary

This project is a straightforward content repository capturing a personal reflection on video gaming habits. It is implemented using Markdown with metadata for potential static site integration. The repository is intended as a reference point for the author to revisit their thoughts on gaming and its effects on their life and productivity.
