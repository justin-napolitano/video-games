This repo contains a personal essay titled "Video Games" that I wrote. It dives into my experiences with gaming, highlighting issues like binge playing, loneliness, and distraction.

### Key Components
- **Narrative**: A reflection on my gaming habits.
- **Format**: Written in Markdown, no heavy tech stack involved.

### Getting Started
No installation needed. To check it out:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/video-games.git
   ```
2. Open `index.md` in any Markdown viewer or text editor.

### Project Structure
```
video-games/
└── index.md    # Main essay file
```

### Gotchas
It's just a text file, so no dynamic content or interactivity here. Future plans include adding more reflections and possibly turning it into a static site for better accessibility.
